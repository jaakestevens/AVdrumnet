This week I have focused on rebuilding my max patch so that new data can be added to the training process without having to enter new survey results or spend 
time working on long calculations. The max patch has been rebuilt so that it runs through any number of presets(36 for my project), it will add each of these 
to their own dataset. For the output results I integrated max eith excel using the cell object.I have sent the survey to multiple participants and entered them 
into an excel spreadsheet. Using the built in excel add function each cell on the 'mean' row calculates the average for each question. The excel sheet is then 
exported as a.csv file and read by the cell object which extracts the row of the mean values. Using zl objects to organise through the clutter of data the list
of values is then split into 6 parts and stored. Using an uzi object and multiple triggers, the output data is successfully paired with the input data in the 
preset object. A seperate counter system then iterates through each item in the preset and sends it individually into a dataset where it is then stored.

Once the data is inside the dataset I simply have to fit it. The good thing about this patch is that it is only for me and not for the user. It allows me to 
very quickly automate training and add more data over the course of the project. As I can just add rows in excel and the mean value will always be calculated I 
do not have to change anything in the max patch. 

Next week I plan to continue collecting data and start working on the patch the user will control the system with. With this training patch I hope to create 
different combinations of applicants, seperating them with things they have in common such as neurodivergence as this is a commmon topic in the psychological field 
of perception. I can then train and save different versions of the network to be loaded and used in the user patch.
