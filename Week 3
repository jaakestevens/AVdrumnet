Due to other assignments, slightly less progress has been made on the drumNet this week. I have updated the training patch so that
it is more concise and easier to work. I've gathered more data for the training patch as well as created two shader-based visuals 
in touchdesigner and GLSL that can be found on my instagram @jaake.stevens.
