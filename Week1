Diary Entry Week 1. 26th - 3rd March

1. I have prepared my dataset that will used for my neural network. 
2. To do this I have created 6 playlists of 6 individual songs from different genres.
3.I have listened to these and created a binary list of the drum patterns in each song from every playlist.
4. Downloaded and external driver that allows me to route audio from spotify to max.
5. With the help of the max MSP external object op.beatitude~, I managed to get the bpm for each of these tracks.
6. Created a questionaire that 6 participants have answered.


Next week I will calculate the mean values for each of genre. These values will eventually be used to change aspects of the neural net

7.With the help of this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-xIuHyhQGE&t=7784s. And this website https://iquilezles.org/articles/. 
I have researched into raymarching and shaders and have created a rough patch that may be incoporated into the final patch.

At this point, I like the idea of using shaders for geometery. I want the final patch to have a 3d shape to be the "protagnist" of the patch.

Here are links to the playlists:

Here are the questions from the survey:

Listen to each playlist as a whole(30s - 1m each track). For each playlist answer these questions and provide your results as a list of 8 numbers.

Questions:
Too which extent do you agree with the following statements(1-10):

If represented visually, this music would be sharp?- __

If represented visually, this music would be a complex shape? - __

The listener is drawn more to the kick drum than the snare drum? __

If represented visually, the colours would be bright and vibrant? - __

If represented visually, this music would appear clear and distinguishable?(as opposed to blurred/foggy) - __

If represented visually, the music would appear complex and “busy” - __

This music would be best appreciated on a run, or fast travel? __

The drums are a primary focus of this music. - __
